# EOSC-SYNERGY -- Organisation of access to the Infrastructure

The Synergy Infrastructure is distributed across multiple countries and
different organisations. This makes it complex to organise the infrastructure
itself. Even more complex is the organisation of access policies, quotas, and
rights.

The fundamental Organisation of the infrastructure is:

- **Resource Providers** (national capacities, e.g. OpenStack Clusters, or HPC)
    connect themselves with the EGI Federated Cloud. 
- **Resource Providers** are free to decide who can access which share (quota) of
    their resources. The technical solution in SYNERGY is to use so called
    **Virtual Organisations** for this.
- **Virtual Organisations** are self-managed groups of Scientists. The
    group Leader (or Principal Investigator, PI) will accept [membership
    requests](how-to-get-access.md) and allocate resources.
