# EOSC-SYNERGY -- How to get Ressources

Shares of the infrastructure (Ressources, Quota) is allocated by each
participating computer centre to a specific VO.

If you are the Manager of a VO, one of your duties is to convince computer
centres to support your VO. In general this is a matter of negotiation between a
Virtual Organisation and a computer centre, and may involve writing
applications, joint grants, or other.

In addition to this EOSC Synergy may allocate specific ressources for specific
Virtual Organisations for a limited amount of time. This is particularly the
case for the GPU resources.

To request access to resources, please send a request, including the following
information to pmb-eosc-synergy@listas.csic.es:
```sh
