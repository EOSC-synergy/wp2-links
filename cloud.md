# Cloud Infrastructure

The infrastructure is built on top of the EGI Federated Cloud. This
provides:

- Virtual Machine
- Monitoring
- Accounting
- Consistent Authentication and Authorisation
- Clear Procedures and professional Change Management

(For links to these, see the [infrastructure](/infrastructure) section.)

### Documentation for EGI FedCloud:

- [EGI Fedcloud Integration](https://egi-federated-cloud-integration.readthedocs.io)
- [EGI Federated Cloud](https://egi-federated-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/storage.html)


## Virtual Infrastructures

Based on Federated Cloud Infrastructures, **Virtual Infrastructures** can
be provisioned.  Since this is a more complex task, only **admin users**
are supposed to do this.  The idea is that admin users will allocate and
instantiate virtual infrastructures on behalf of their thematic service.

## Virtual Organisations

Virtual Organisations (VOs) are used to form communities and to allocate
infrastructure to them.  In EOSC-Synergy, we have (this is in progress)
one Virtual Organisation per Thematic Service. Most of our [Computer
centres](/infrastructure#sites) support all of the synergy thematic
services.
